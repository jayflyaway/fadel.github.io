## About
I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the [RECOD Lab](http://www.recod.ic.unicamp.br/) ([Institute of Computing](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/), [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/)), advised by prof. [Ricardo Torres](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rtorres/).
My research interests are mostly on supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning using neural networks.

I have a MSc in CS, from the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br/) (USP), advised by prof. [Fernando Paulovich](http://sites.google.com/site/fpaulovich/).
During that time, I spent 3 months with the [Scientific Visualization and Computer Graphics](http://www.cs.rug.nl/svcg/) research group ([University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), Netherlands), advised by prof. [Alex Telea](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/).

I also have a BSc in CS from USP.

### mp (R package)
I have developed, jointly with Francisco Fatore, the [mp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mp) package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
It contains implementations of some multidimensional projection techniques, useful for visualizing high dimensional data.
Hoping to achieve very good performance, many techniques are written in C++ using [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) (with [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) and [RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo)).
