## About
I am currently (from July 2019 to July 2020) a visiting researcher at the [ML3](http://ml3.leuphana.de/) research group ([Leuphana University](https://www.leuphana.de/), Germany), advised by Prof. [Ulf Brefeld](http://ml3.leuphana.de/ulf.html), as part of my PhD.
I started my PhD in Computer Science at the [RECOD Lab](http://www.recod.ic.unicamp.br/) ([Institute of Computing](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/), [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/)), advised by Prof. [Ricardo Torres](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ricardo.torres).

My main research interests are on unsupervised learning, particularly with structured (relational) representations.

I have a MSc in CS, from the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.usp.br/) (USP), advised by Prof. [Fernando Paulovich](http://sites.google.com/site/fpaulovich/).
During that time, I spent 3 months with the [Scientific Visualization and Computer Graphics](http://www.cs.rug.nl/svcg/) research group ([University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), Netherlands), advised by Prof. [Alex Telea](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~alext/).
I also have a BSc in CS from USP.
